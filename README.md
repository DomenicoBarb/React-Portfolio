## Installation
This application uses Node.js and various npm packages so you will need to install node and then run ```npm i``` in the terminal at the root of the directory to install the dependencies.

## Usage
After installing Node.js and running ```npm i``` in the terminal at the root directory, you will now run ```npm run deploy``` in the terminal at the root of the directory to launch the application. This will create a build folder and deploy the application to GitHub Pages. You can then navigate to https://domenicobarb.github.io/React-Portfolio/ in your browser to use the application.
